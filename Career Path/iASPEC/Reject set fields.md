Confirmed with user:
(1) PACS.002 reject charge charging bank should be always instructed agent of 002 (inward settlement method is not always correct (e.g. inward 008/009 settlementMethod = COVE), must be resolved separately)
(2) If cannot resolve related nostro/vostro account, do not allow user edit charge amount / only zero is accepted 

Suggestion:
(When creating PACS.002 reject)
(1) Add a new key "rejectChargeSettlementMethod"
(2) switch (inward 008/009 settlementMethod):
    settlementMethod = CLRG -> rejectChargeSettlementMethod = null
    settlementMethod = INDA/INGA -> rejectChargeSettlementMethod = inwardSettlementMethod
    settlementMethod = COVE -> resolve the rejectChargeSettlementMethod (refer to SearchIwBankRelatedAccountsApiHandler)
(3) Use the rejectChargeSettlementMethod for display and calculate charge
(4) If rejectChargeSettlementMethod = null, set charge amount = 0 and do not allow user edit
