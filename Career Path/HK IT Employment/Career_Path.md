### What is the difference between a Programmer Analyst and a Software Engineer?

Both Programmer Analysts and Software Engineers have the skills necessary to code, test and troubleshoot software programs. However, they differ in the types of job environments in which they work and the types of software they create. For example, Programmer Analysts typically work for corporations to develop, repair and maintain company-specific software programs. Their goal is to identify company needs and create software programs to maximize their business operations.

In contrast, Software Engineers can work for corporations, tech companies or software engineering firms. They may be responsible for developing company software, but they can also design various other software applications, including mobile applications, websites or video games.
